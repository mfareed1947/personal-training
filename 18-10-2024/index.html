      Programming, or coding, is like solving a puzzle. Consider a human
      language, like <b>English</b> or <b>French</b>. We use these languages to
      turn thoughts and ideas into actions <hr> and behavior. In programming, the
      goal of the <i>puzzle is exactly the same</i>-- you're just driving
      different kinds of behavior, <br/> and the source of that behavior isn't a
      human. It's a computer.
